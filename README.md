# Learn Go

Welcome to the **Learn Go** repository! This project serves as a personal journey to mastering the Go programming language, following the principles outlined in the book [**Learn Go with Tests**](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/).

## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview

The primary goal of this repository is to:

- Deepen understanding of Go through hands-on practice.
- Implement test-driven development (TDD) to write clean and maintainable code.
- Explore various Go concepts and standard library features.

## ðŸ§ª Learning Approach

This repository is structured around the chapters and exercises from **Learn Go with Tests**, focusing on:

- Exploring Go's standard library and built-in features.
- Unit testing with the `testing` package.
- Writing tests before code (TDD).
- Developing small, testable units of code.
- Refactoring code to improve quality and clarity.
- Table-driven tests for cleaner and more readable test cases.
- Mocking dependencies to isolate units under test.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The repository is organized into directories, each focusing on a particular Go concept:

- `init/`
- `integers/`
- `iteration/`
- `arrays/`
- `structs/`
- `pointers/`
- `maps/`
- `dependency-injection/`
- `mocking/`
- `concurrency/`
- `select/`
- `reflection/`
- `sync/`
- `context/`
- `roman-numerals/`
- `generics/`

Each directory contains:

- A Go file implementing the concept.
- A test file with corresponding test cases.

## ðŸ“š Acknowledgments
